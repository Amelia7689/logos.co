Building the Logos Ecosystem.

When all three of these networks reach production, and there exists seamless developer tooling, a solid foundation will be set for building truly peer-to-peer applications.

Ethereum has demonstrated what’s possible when a global community conducts experiments to create decentralized applications and services. In their current form these aren’t decentralized given their front-ends and the current dependency on Infura. They nevertheless show how quickly an economy and ecosystem can form when useful technology exists.

Logos will also require developer education and advocacy, but have a focus primarily on people who share our principles and political views, rather than remaining completely apolitical. 

We are actively looking for people to help shape this.
