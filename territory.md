## Logos Zones

Establishing Real World Communities.

We envisage the emergence of autonomous, crypto-native communities all around the world utilizing Logosâ€™ infrastructure and, paving way to economic opportunities for communities to thrive whilst respecting their freedoms. 
To seed the idea and provide a proof of concept, we are currently exploring small, entirely crypto-native community who wish to live at the frontier and inspire others to do the same.

We expect this transaction to take place in Q3/Q4 2022, after which time the land will be transferred to a non-profit foundation which is held accountable 
by anyone who volunteers to live on the island through a set of governance smart contracts

Logos is building a network of assets on chain, starting with a nature and wildlife preservation in Europe. Each parcel of land is an NFT that can be owned collectively by the DAO collectively or by individuals. It is a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, meaning it is managed by the community.

Why put land on the blockchain?

Digitizing physical assets democratizes access, increases transparency, removes gatekeepers, and reduces complexity. Putting land on chain has several benefits:

- Instant land transfers, reduced legal complexity
- Democratization of ownership through crowdfunding. 
- Currently land is only available to large investors who can afford an entire parcel.
- Open, transparent, programmable digital records

Our hope is that Logos DAO is able to buy land all over the US and world. We are starting in Europe because of the number of SEZs, which recognizes DAO governance of LLC corporations. Because LLCs can own land, this creates a powerful pathway for decentralized land ownership.
