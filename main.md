## Logos is the world’s first Network State

Logos is the world’s first Network State designed to enable new types of applications and institutions that uphold basic human rights.


Logos is a grassroots movement to build a new society using peer-to-peer technologies – enabling anyone to freely express themselves, explore and create.
It all begins with a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) dedicated to the construction of a user-owned, self-sovereign crypto network. The network is comprised of modular peer-to-peer protocols for communication, file storage and transactions. These form the foundational public infrastructure of Logos – and will lead to the emergence of a new class of applications, public goods and social institutions that uphold our basic human rights by design.

We invite technologists, creatives and policy experts – along with anyone who is passionate about our mission – to participate in the creation of Logos, and to help govern its future.
