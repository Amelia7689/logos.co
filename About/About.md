Logos is a continuation of the original cypherpunk movement, advocating the widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change.

We believe that technological advancements in cryptography and peer-to-peer networking can change the way we organise our societies, unlocking a new social fabric and a shared public infrastructure.

We believe that crypto networks can lead us to a world with more humane social institutions and applications, a world free from mass surveillance and censorship, and a world that shifts the enforcement of privacy and property rights onto the individual as a means of emancipation.

Logos is built and operated entirely by its open source community. If you share our values and vision, we invite you to join us through the still-early stages of this experiment.
