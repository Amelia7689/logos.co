Why?

The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters.

We live in a world where communication is instant, and yet so many of us feel that we have no control over our own lives. We struggle to find a place for self-exploration, a community where we belong, and a meaning to live that is larger than ourselves.

Big tech, big banks and public services are failing us. Trust in government and media are at an all-time low. The archaic technology we use to operate our institutions is not up to the task of guiding modern democracies through the information age. Governments and financial institutions force us to entrust all of our personal data to arbitrary entities. Each passing year sees new security breaches, new attempts to force surveillance into law, new violations of our privacy, and new corruption scandals. The surveillance state Leviathan seems only to get stronger.

But we needn’t feel desolate. Advancements in cryptography and peer-to-peer technologies point to a brighter future ahead. The social fabric – the operating systems for our lives – can be completely reimagined. Individuals and communities will be able to enforce their own property and privacy rights, and to experiment with new types of social and economic institutions that could bring greater transparency and accountability to the world. New communities will form that live their entire daily lives within crypto systems, left free to peacefully explore and create.

We at Logos are laying the foundations for a new society: a parallel world that runs atop of crypto networks. A world for cryptonatives is being born: providing a pathway to give control back to the people.

Will you join us in building this future together?
