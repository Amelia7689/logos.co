##  What is Logos?

Logos is a continuation of the original cypherpunk movement advocating for the widespread use of strong cryptography and technologies that enhance 
privacy and self-sovereignty.At its base, Logos is a complete infrastructure stack - with modular protocols for communication, file storage, and smart contracts.

But at its core, Logos is a grassroots movement unified in our belief in protecting human rights and defending against tyranny through technology.
We invites technologists, creatives, and policy experts, along with anyone passionate about our mission to participate in its creation, and help govern 
its future

Why?

The world needs more humane technology, and environments that respect our freedom.

We stand at the dawn of a new era. Big Tech, big banks, and even public institutions are failing us. 
Trust in government and social institutions continue to fall. And for good reason - entrusting all of our 
personal data to these arbitrary entities on the internet, and all of our financial resources to faceless 
bureaucracies has proven a fundamentally flawed model.

For every day we see new security breaches, new attempts to force surveillance into law, new violations 
of our privacy, and new corruption scandals emerge. The surveillance state Leviathan appears to be only 
becoming stronger. But we needn't feel desolate.

Through advancements in cryptography and p2p software, there’s a brighter future ahead. We’re laying the 
foundation for the creation of a parallel set of institutions and services, that will run atop open source, 
peer-to-peer networks. We believe in building the future we want to live in, and conducting our lives using 
these systems will lead to a more peaceful, trustworthy 21st century.

Logos is an experiment to build a new society at the frontier - where people are free to express themselves, 
and peacefully explore and create. And we need your help.
