##  What is Logos?
Logos is a continuation of the original cypherpunk movement advocating for the widespread use of strong cryptography and technologies that enhance privacy and self-sovereignty. At its base, Logos is a complete infrastructure stack - with modular protocols for communication, file storage, and generalized trustless agreement.

But at its core, Logos is a grassroots movement unified in our belief in protecting human rights and defending against tyranny through technology. We invite technologists, creatives, and policy experts, along with anyone passionate about our mission to participate in its creation, and help govern its future.
