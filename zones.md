## Logos Zones

Establishing Real World Communities.

We envisage the emergence of autonomous, crypto-native communities all around the world utilizing Logosâ€™ infrastructure and, paving way to economic opportunities for communities to thrive whilst respecting their freedoms. 
To seed the idea and provide a proof of concept, we are currently exploring small, entirely crypto-native community who wish to live at the frontier and inspire others to do the same.

We expect this transaction to take place in Q3/Q4 2022, after which time the land will be transferred to a non-profit foundation which is held accountable 
by anyone who volunteers to live on the island through a set of governance smart contracts
