Codex is a decentralized file storage network.

Whilst p2p storage networks have been around for quite a long time, the lack of incentives, 
strong data availability, and persistence guarantees make these networks unsuitable for applications 
with moderate to high availability requirements. In other words, without reliability at the storage 
layer it is impossible to build other reliable applications on top of it. Codex aims to solve this by supplying:

An incentivized p2p storage network with strong availability and persistence guarantees.
A resource restricted friendly protocol that can endure higher levels of churn and large amounts of ephemeral devices.
Codex has a working PoC available on request, as is expected to be in production by 2023.
